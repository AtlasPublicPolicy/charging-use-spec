## Near Term
Planned additions by May 15, 2022
* **Registration and Session Data Collection Validations** – This section will describe the procedures and parameters for validating collected data to flag erroneous data and other data-quality issues. Validations include verification that data meets expected input type, checking whether station location is within program jurisdictional boundaries, and whether charging station use values fall within charging station parameters.
* **Session Data Transformation, Calculation, and Aggregation** – This section will describe in detail the process of taking session data and transforming it into reporting outputs such as sessions counts, energy delivery, among others.
* **Session Data Reporting Format and Metrics** – This section will outline model reporting outputs generated from session inputs. These outputs provide information on aggregate charger performance across key metrics and at varying levels of aggregation.
* **Model Language for Data Access** – Resource for program administrators to include in program documentation to ensure that the program administrator or its agent can collect and use data from obligated parties or designated data providers.
* **Example Data** – Example data files for each specification table.
## Long Term
Planned additions in Summer 2022
* **Station Reliability** – Standardized data collection and reporting of reliability metrics such as up time, and measurements of charging session success.

* **Charging Equipment and Installation Costs** – standardized collection of detailed costs data, such as equipment cost and line-item installation costs.

* **Grid impacts** – Standardized collection and reporting of station electricity usage intervals for use in energy demand forecasting and resource planning and to understand the present and future effects that charging station deployment will have on the electrical grid.
