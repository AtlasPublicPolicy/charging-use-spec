# Specification Roadmap

## Next steps

Planned additions in Summer 2022

* **Example Data** – Example data files for each specification table.

* **Station Reliability** – Standardized data collection and reporting of reliability metrics such as up time, and measurements of charging session success.

* **Charging Equipment and Installation Costs** – standardized collection of detailed costs data, such as equipment cost and line-item installation costs.

* **Grid impacts** – Standardized collection and reporting of station electricity usage intervals for use in energy demand forecasting and resource planning and to understand the present and future effects that charging station deployment will have on the electrical grid.
