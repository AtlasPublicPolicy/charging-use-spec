# Core Registration and Operating Data Collection Reference

This document outlines the process, structure, and format for: 1) registering projects, and associated stations and ports, and 2) collecting core station operating (session & cost) data. These data are then [validated](validation-reference.md) with the resulting information compiled into standard [reporting metrics](reporting-metric-reference).

1. **Registration data** contains records of each project, station and port deployed by the program. These data are collected from the [obligated party](../glossary.md) or [data provider](../glossary.md) at the point of funding by the [program administrator](../glossary.md) and then transmitted to the [data aggregator](../glossary.md).

2. **Use (session) data** contains records of the individual charging sessions at program-funded stations. These data are collected for each reporting period by the [data provider](../glossary.md) and transmitted to the [data aggregator](../glossary.md). Registration information is also used in specification extensions linking to cost [[FORTHCOMING]](roadmap.md), reliability [[FORTHCOMING]](roadmap.md), and grid impact [[FORTHCOMING]](roadmap.md) reporting specifications.

# Program Registry and Onboarding Process

The program registry contains entries for all charging ports deployed by program funding and is a critical component of the evaluation, measurement, and verification process because it contains the reference information required for program reporting activities. Project registration data is collected and maintained by the [program administrator](../glossary.md) or [data aggregator](../glossary.md). Recommended practice is to integrate registration data collection with administrative onboarding processes to reduce duplicative effort and ensure that all necessary registration data collection occurs prior to funding disbursement. Figure 1 shows the program registry hierarchy with individual identifying keys that link the entries together.

Project registration is tied to a single [obligated party](../glossary.md) and records project-level information such as funding source and amounts. Projects are limited to a single physical address but may cover many individual charging port deployments. Station registration (based on address) is recorded in parallel with project onboarding. While a project is limited to a single station, a station may receive funding from multiple projects over time. If a second project is applied to a station that is already in the system, then it should be linked to the existing station rather than generating a new station entry.

Because charging ports generate usage data, they are the fundamental reporting unit in the program registry. Sessions and other usage data are linked to ports, which inherit all above attributes, making it possible to link each session to the associated station, project, and [obligated party](../glossary.md). In many cases, the [obligated party](../glossary.md) will not be the organization that directly collects charging use data. Instead, many obligated parties will deploy chargers managed by a third party that monitors port usage.

To facilitate efficient data sharing, the third party that monitors port usage may also be designated as the [data provider](../glossary.md), which allows for direct data transfer to the [data aggregator](../glossary.md) and may also provide efficiencies of scale if the third-party [data provider](../glossary.md) is contracted with multiple obligated parties. In this case, the participant must provide the [program administrator](../glossary.md) with port identifiers that are consistent with those used by the [data provider](../glossary.md) as well as the necessary credentials and information to access reported usage data. See model language for data collection [[FORTHCOMING]](roadmap.md) for sample language to facilitate the efficient collection of data.

*Fields marked as required must be included to comply with the specification, while optional fields may be made required at the discretion of the program administrator*

## Project Registration

During project onboarding the [program administrator](global-reference.md) will collect and record project-level information from the applicant [obligated party](../glossary.md) as outlined in Table 1. Project registration includes applicant information and general information on project funding including public/utility funding source and amount, and must be associated with a single geographic location (station). If detailed cost information, including itemized installation costs are desired, please see the installation costs extension [[FORTHCOMING]](roadmap.md).

Refer to [Field Type and Format Reference](../field-type-and-format-reference.md) for more information on field types and formats. *Additional fields may be appended as new columns are needed, but existing columns and their formats should be maintained to support compatibility.*

## Station Registration

Also during project onboarding, the [program administrator](../glossary.md) will collect station information from the applicant [obligated party](../glossary.md). If the station address of the project matches a station already in the station registry, then the project should be associated with the existing station\_id.

## Port Registration

Also during project onboarding, the [program administrator](../glossary.md) will collect port information from the applicant [obligated party](../glossary.md). If usage data will be provided by a third-party [data provider](../glossary.md), collecting the port identifier used by that third party to identify specific ports in their system is a critical step in the onboarding process. This ensures that the [data aggregator](../glossary.md) can successfully link usage data secured from the [data provider](../glossary.md) to ports within the registry. The [program administrator](../glossary.md) should also have a process in place to update the port registration if a port is upgraded, taken offline, or if the [data provider](../glossary.md) is replaced.

Each port inherits the attributes of the site where it is located and the project that funded it. port registration entries also include attributes specific to the individual charging port including exact location, power level, and other port-level attributes as listed in Table 3.

# Operating Data Collection

Port usage is tracked by collecting data on:
* **individual charging sessions** โ the period between when a user connects their vehicle (plug in) and disconnects their vehicle (plug out).  
* **station operating costs** โ summary data on energy, maintenance and repair costs over the reporitng interval.

### Session Data
The [data provider](../glossary.md) collects session data for each reporting period as defined by the [program administrator](../glossary.md). The data is transmitted to the [data aggregator](../glossary.md) by the [data provider](global-reference.md) (or [obligated party](../glossary.md) in the case where they operate their ports). Session data includes key information about how, when, and, for how long a charger is in use over the course of a single session (plug in to plug out). Each individual session should be included in the data only once. If data is collected at a subsession interval, it should be aggregated to the session level by the data provider prior to delivery to the data aggregator. Session data is keyed to the individual port where it occurred and inherits all above attributes of the participant, project, and station as shown in Figure 2.

Generally, the [data provider](../glossary.md) may transmit session data to the [data aggregator](../glossary.md) by: data portal, FTP, API, email, or other data sharing procedure. While data sharing is designed to be container agnostic, session data must conform to the format described in Table 5 and should be stored in (or convertible to) a broadly compatible container, such as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Data transmissions procedure and file format may be further specified by the [program administrator](../glossary.md) to suit program needs.

Refer to [Field Type and Format Reference](../field-type-and-format-reference.md) for more information on field types and formats. *Additional fields may be appended as new columns as needed, but existing columns and their formats should be maintained to support compatibility.*

### Operating Costs Data

Operating costs are collected by the [obligated party](../glossary.md) or the [data provider](../glossary.md). Operating costs data may be submitted by an online form, reporting spreadsheet or other reporting method as specified by the [program administrator](../glossary.md) or [data aggregator](../glossary.md). Because collection of operating costs data is labor intensive, recommended practice is to collect these data on an infrequent basis.
